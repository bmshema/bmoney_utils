### word_salad.py:
Processes input wordlists by splitting them into sections and applying user-specified actions (reverse, randomize, or none) to each section, then saves the modified sections as separate output files.
### psk_extract.py:
Extracts sequences of characters between 8 and 63 ASCII-encoded characters from input wordlist(s) and saved to new file.
